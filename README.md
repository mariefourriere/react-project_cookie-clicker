# Introduction

Part of our becode training, we had to create a game using React. Here is the main instruction given:

>ou start the game with a "cookie" to click on. Clicking on it will increase your score by one
>Once you reach a certain amount of cookie (eg.: 10). You can buy your first building. Buildings allow you to generate cookie automatically
>The more you buy a certain type of building, the more it becomes expensive.
>You gradually unlock new building as your cookie production grows.
